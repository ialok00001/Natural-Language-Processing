# Natural-Language-Processing

This repository contains all the assignments to the course **Natural Language Processing**, which I took in my second year of M.Sc Data Science. It contain various assignments, starting from validating Heap's and Zipf's laws, upto creating language models that compare similarities between words.

1) **Validation of Heap's and Zipf's Law**
   In this assignment, we have to use a corpus on papers regarding Covid-19, extract, preprocess and save it for later use, and then verify the Heap's and Zipf's law using the same.
